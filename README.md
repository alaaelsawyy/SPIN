## Introduction to SPIN

SPIN is a startup program with the goal of spreading space technology and science in Egypt and the Middle East. SPIN mission is to motivate, guide, and empower these youthful talents, enabling them to create groundbreaking space technologies that will define our future. it is committed to fostering space technology that not only contributes to Egypt's progress and prosperity but also enhances our standing in the regional and international aerospace industry.
